## How to Run the Project in Your Local

To safely develop new features and avoid breaking production, you should set up your own Firebase project and local environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeeBoYin/everygram-nuxt.git
    cd everygram-nuxt
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required dependencies for frontend:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Install the required dependencies for backend:

    ```bash
    cd functions
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup Firebase Project**

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create a new project (or use an existing one).
    - Register Web app in the Firebase Console.
    - Enable Authentication (Google signin), Cloud Functions, Firestore and Storage.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Add your Firebase environment variables as shown below:

    ```env
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project.firebaseio.com
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    NUXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
    ```

5. **Add Firebase Admin SDK Credentials**

    Create your Firebase Admin SDK JSON file at:

    ```
    functions/src/everygram-firebase-adminsdk.json
    ```

    You can generate this file from your Firebase project settings under "Service accounts".

6. **Deploy Rules and Functions to Firebase**

    Sign in to your Firebase account:

    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    firebase login
    ```

    Publish rules for Firestore and Storage.

    ```bash
    npm run deploy-rules
    ```

    Deploy Cloud Functions to Firebase, run:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy-functions
    ```

7. **Launch the Nuxt Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
